For the synthetic expirements on the Regular Graph (RG), please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/SitaoLuan/When-Do-GNNs-Help/tree/main)

The following script computes the metric values for synthetic graphs (```PA```, ```RG``` or ```Gencat```) and saves the results under corresponding folder under ```metrics_results```, e.g. ```RG/edge_0.1.pt``` is the edge homophily values for 10 graphs generated using RG with homophily coefficient 0.1.
```python
python hetero_metric_syn.py --mode 'RG' --metric 'edge' --homo_lvl 0.1
```
The summarized results for each methods containing all metrics are provided under ```metrics_results```, e.g., ```RG.pt```
